Meghan Trainor, 26, has joined The Voice UK 2020 as a new coach, replacing Jennifer Hudson who quit last year due to filming commitments. The US singer will be seen judging contestants’ voices alongside returning stars, Olly Murs, Will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones. Speaking about how Meghan was during filming for the blind auditions, Olly admitted they were “annoyed” with her as the first contestant of the series chose her to be their team captain. In an interview with OK! Magazine about the All About That Bass hitmaker, Olly said: “She surprised us. She was nervous on the first day of filming but she grew as the day went on. “She said before she went out, ‘Oh my God, Olly, no one is going to pick me. What have I got to do?’ and then she got the first competitor! “All four of us turned for this one girl and Meghan got her. We were annoyed,” he laughed.",
